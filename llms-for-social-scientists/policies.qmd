## AI Use

I encourage the use of generative AI tools when completing the assignments for this module, but all work relying on AI-generated content must adhere to the highest academic standards. Users of this technology must be aware of what it can and, more importantly, what it cannot do well. It is crucial for you to exercise judgement when evaluating the quality and reliability of content generated through AI platforms.

AI is not a panacea for all writing challenges; it will not automatically generate a flawless, logically coherent, and factually correct assignment. Instead, use AI as a tool to tackle specific issues such as brainstorming and idea formation, literature discovery, and text drafting. View your preferred AI platform(s) as useful but imperfect tools that can offer inspiration, new perspectives, and supplementary areas for research for your own work. In-depth research on your part remains essential to ensure coherent, factual, and scientifically informed perspectives in your assignment. Always cross-reference the information AI offers against other independent and reliable sources.

AI use must be in line with UCD's policies on [academic integrity](https://libguides.ucd.ie/academicintegrity).

### Documenting AI Use

You are expected to provide an account of the tools used and how they were used in a **mandatory appendix** to your group project. This appendix will be assessed as part of each assignment, with grade points awarded for effective communication of the methods used to generate content.

For each instance where a generative AI tool is used, you need to provide:

1. An in-text citation or footnote
2. A bibliographic reference to the tool used and the date of access
3. An entry in the mandatory AI appendix detailing how the tool was used

For code, while I do not expect you to keep a log of all prompts used, I do expect you to add comments indicating where code has fully or partially been generated by a tool such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.

### Suggested AI Tools

- **ChatGPT** -- good at writing code
- **Claude** -- better than ChatGPT at writing text
- **Gemini** -- fast and useful integrations
- **Perplexity** -- great for finding relevant web pages and documents
- **HuggingChat** -- open source, flexible, and free

## Plagiarism

Academic integrity is one of the core values of the UCD Education Strategy. Plagiarism is the inclusion, in any form of assessment, of material without due acknowledgement of its original source. See UCD's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://libguides.ucd.ie/academicintegrity) for full details.

## Late Submission

Lab notebooks submitted late will not be accepted unless an extension has been granted. For group projects submitted past the due date:

- Coursework received within **5 working days** after the due date will have the grade reduced by **one grade point**.
- Coursework received between **5 and 10 working days** after the due date will have the grade reduced by **two grade points**.
- Coursework received **more than 10 working days** after the due date will not be accepted.

## Office Hours

Weekly office hours during the teaching term: Wednesdays, 15:00--16:00. Book a slot via Calendly if you wish to attend, either in person or online.

## Syllabus Modification Rights

I reserve the right to reasonably alter the elements of the syllabus at any time to keep pace with the course schedule. If adjustments are made, the revised syllabus will be uploaded to Brightspace.
