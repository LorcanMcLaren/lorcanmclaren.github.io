# Software {.unnumbered}

All code for this course should be written in **Python**. For those who haven't worked with this language previously, POL42340 Programming for Social Scientists runs in parallel to this course and provides a comprehensive introduction to Python.

## Development Environment

We will use **VS Code** to write and execute code locally. For some lab sessions and the group project, where your personal device may not be powerful enough or where long execution times are expected, **Google Colab** should be used. Colab provides limited free access to T4 GPUs, which will enable you to run code that cannot be executed locally without a GPU.

## Package Management

We will use `venv` and `pip` to manage our Python environment and install packages (though feel free to use Anaconda if you are more familiar with this platform). I strongly encourage the use of **Git** for version control, particularly when working on your group project; however, we will not cover this extensively in class.

## Useful Python Packages

The following packages are particularly useful for dealing with textual data:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `spaCy` | Industrial-strength NLP library |
| `NLTK` | Classic NLP toolkit |
| `Gensim` | Topic modelling and word embeddings |
| `sentence-transformers` | Sentence and document embeddings |
| `transformers` | HuggingFace model hub and pipelines |
| `langchain` | Framework for building LLM applications |
| `scikit-learn` | Machine learning and evaluation metrics |
