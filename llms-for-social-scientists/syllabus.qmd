# Syllabus {.unnumbered}

## Course Structure

Each class involves a lecture introducing the topic, followed by a hands-on lab session where we work on exercises related to the lecture content. Students are expected to complete the readings before class each week, and to submit their lab work via Brightspace.

See the [Weekly Content](weeks/week-01.qmd) chapters for detailed content for each session.
