I am currently developing a customisable tool to provide an improved text annotation workflow to researchers. Creating large sets of annotated text is a common task in many text-as-data approaches. Recent advancements in LLMs have accelerated this trend, as domain-specific ground truth is important for validating zero- and few-shot models, or for fine-tuning. 

My tool provides the following benefits at **zero** cost:

- Consistent experience for teams of annotators
- Low-latency, reproducible workflows 
- Multiple common annotation types, including binary, dropdown or Likert scale
- Fully customisable, with functionality to develop your own annotation schema and instructions
- No more messy codebooks that require annotators to switch between windows
- CSV input and output for interoperability
