    "text": "I am currently developing a customisable tool to provide an improved text annotation workflow to researchers. Creating large sets of annotated text is a common task in many text-as-data approaches. Recent advancements in LLMs have accelerated this trend, as domain-specific ground truth is important for validating zero- and few-shot models, or for fine-tuning.\nMy tool provides the following benefits at zero cost:\n\nConsistent experience for teams of annotators\nLow-latency, reproducible workflows\nMultiple common annotation types, including binary, dropdown or Likert scale\nFully customisable, with functionality to develop your own annotation schema and instructions\nNo more messy codebooks that force annotators to switch windows\nCSV input and output for interoperability\n\n\nTry out a beta version of the tool here. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any bugs or need additional features for your annotation task"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nAnalysis of human interactions benefits from understanding patterns of gaze in dialogue. Using a multi-modal task oriented dialogue corpus, we evaluate relations between gaze behaviours, conversational dominance and dialogue role. Dominant players spend more time looking at their co-player than their less dominant fellows; the facilitator spends more time gazing at the dominant player than at the less dominant; dominant players spend longer averting their gaze than their less dominant fellows. When aligned with dialogue roles, gaze behaviour differences between players are demonstrated when occupying the role of speaker but not of listener. Less dominant speakers gaze longer at a facilitator, while effects on averted gaze and co-player directed gaze remain present for dominant speakers but not for dominant listeners. Finally, where dominance is not balanced among players, mutual gaze involving players only is less than mutual gaze involving facilitators."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change presents an existential risk to global society, yet public engagement has not risen to meet this challenge. Although research suggests that manipulating psychological distance could enhance the effectiveness of climate communication, it remains unclear whether politicians employ this strategy. This paper addresses this gap by developing and validating automated methods to measure psychological distance in political speech. I introduce a dataset of 35,000 speeches from the European Parliament on climate-related topics from 2014 to 2023, translated into English to bypass multilingual modelling challenges. I present a novel tool designed to streamline the annotation of long-form texts, enhancing efficiency and consistency among annotators. Finally, I explore and validate the use of generative language models to synthesise training data for fine-tuning bidirectional encoder models in order to measure psychological distance in text. This approach demonstrates strong performance and allows for scalable analysis of complex phenomena in natural language. It paves the way for future substantive research on the dynamics of European climate politics."
