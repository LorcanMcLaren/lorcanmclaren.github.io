The Psychological Distance of Climate Change in Parliamentary Speech\n        \n    \n    Abstract\n    \n    \n        Climate change represents an existential risk to global society, yet public engagement has not fully risen to meet the challenge. Political speech can change citizens' support for climate action and willingness to modify their behaviour. One feature that matters – including when speaking to oppositional audiences about climate – is psychological distance: the sense of proximity or distance from the impacts of climate change created by the speech. While extensive research demonstrates its importance for persuasion, it is unclear whether politicians employ this feature strategically. This paper addresses that gap by developing and validating automated methods to measure psychological distance in political speech. I introduce a translated dataset of 35,000 European Parliament speeches on climate-related topics (2014-2024). I explore and validate the use of generative language models to label training data for fine-tuning encoder classifiers, in order to identify this feature. Subsequent analysis sheds light on the internal and external motivators of climate communication, including the demographic characteristics of legislators and their ideological positions. Future avenues for research on the drivers of European climate politics are discussed, as are the implications for communication practitioners.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        A Heuristic Method for Automatic Gaze Detection in Constrained Multi-Modal Dialogue Corpora\n    with Maria Koutsombogera and Carl Vogel.\n    Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), 2020.\n    Paper | Open Access | Code\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        Gaze, Dominance and Dialogue Role in the MULTISIMO Corpus\n    with Maria Koutsombogera and Carl Vogel.\n    Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), 2020.\n    Paper | Open Access\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n    \n        \n        Text Annotation Tooling\n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n            \n                \n            \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nNo matching items"

Using a multi-modal task oriented dialogue corpus, we evaluate relations between gaze behaviours, conversational dominance and dialogue role. Dominant players spend more time looking at their co-player than their less dominant fellows; the facilitator spends more time gazing at the dominant player than at the less dominant; dominant players spend longer averting their gaze than their less dominant fellows. When aligned with dialogue roles, gaze behaviour differences between players are demonstrated when occupying the role of speaker but not of listener. Less dominant speakers gaze longer at a facilitator, while effects on averted gaze and co-player directed gaze remain present for dominant speakers but not for dominant listeners. Finally, where dominance is not balanced among players, mutual gaze involving players only is less than mutual gaze involving facilitators."
