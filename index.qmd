I am a PhD researcher and Iseult Honohan scholar in computational social science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/). Based in the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/) under the supervision of [James P. Cross](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tx3mu9kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I also serve as a Climate Fellow at the UCD Earth Institute. My research employs text-as-data approaches to examine political communication, with a particular focus on the climate crisis.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed a BA in Computer Science, Linguistics and French at Trinity College Dublin and an MSc in Politics and Data Science at University College Dublin, complemented by two years of industry experience as a data analyst.
