### Welcome

Welcome to my academic portal, where my journey through the intricate world of computational social science unfolds. As a PhD student, I delve into the dynamics of political communication, particularly through the lens of climate change discourse, leveraging text-as-data methodologies.

### Research Interests

My research interests are centered around understanding the narratives in political communication, with a special emphasis on climate change. Utilizing computational tools, I analyze large datasets of textual information to uncover patterns, sentiments, and framing techniques used in political discourse related to environmental issues.

### Publications

-   "Decoding Political Sentiment in Climate Change Discourse: A Text-as-Data Approach," Journal of Computational Social Science, 2023.
-   "Framing the Future: The Narrative Battle in Climate Policy Debates," Environmental Communication Quarterly, 2024.

### Projects

-   **ClimateSpeak Analysis**: An extensive project that uses natural language processing to examine the rhetoric used by policymakers in climate change debates, aiming to identify key influencers and sentiment trends.
-   **EcoNarratives**: A collaborative effort focusing on the portrayal of climate change in media across different political spectrums, assessing the impact on public perception and policy engagement.
