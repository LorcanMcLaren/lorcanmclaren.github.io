I am a PhD researcher and Iseult Honohan scholar in computational social science at the [UCD School of Politics and International Relations](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/). I am a member of the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/), and advised by [James P. Cross](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tx3mu9kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

My research examines political communication using text-as-data approaches, with a focus on the climate crisis. 

Previously, I completed a BA in Computer Science, Linguistics and French at Trinity College Dublin and an MSc in Politics and Data Science at University College Dublin. I also worked in industry for two years as a data analyst.
