I am a PhD researcher in computational social science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/), funded by a Taighde Éireann - Research Ireland Government of Ireland scholarship. Based in the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/) under the supervision of [James P. Cross](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tx3mu9kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), my research employs text-as-data approaches to examine political communication, with a particular focus on the climate crisis. Previously, I was supported by the Iseult Honohan scholarship and served as a Climate Fellow at the UCD Earth Institute.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed a BA in Computer Science, Linguistics and French at Trinity College Dublin and an MSc in Politics and Data Science at University College Dublin, complemented by two years of industry experience as a data analyst.
